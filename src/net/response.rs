//! Minimal HTTP response model.
//!
//! This struct represents a **fully buffered** HTTP response returned by the
//! network layer. It contains the final URL (after redirects, if the client
//! follows them), status code + reason, response headers, and the raw body bytes.
//!
//! ## Notes
//! - The body is stored as raw `Vec<u8>`. For text responses, convert with
//!   `String::from_utf8_lossy(&resp.body)` or similar. For JSON, parse with
//!   `serde_json::from_slice::<T>(&resp.body)`.
//! - `headers` is an `http::HeaderMap`, which is **case-insensitive** for
//!   header names.
//! - `status_text` is typically derived from the status codeâ€™s canonical
//!   reason phrase and may be `"Unknown"` for non-standard codes.
//!
