//! Render backend abstraction.
//!
//! This module defines the traits and data structures needed to implement
//! different rendering backends (e.g. Cairo, Vello, Skia). Backends provide
//! surfaces for rendering, expose handles to host applications, and generate
//! snapshots for thumbnails/tab switchers.
//!
//! # Key Concepts
//!
//! - [`RenderBackend`]: Core trait that all backends must implement.
//! - [`ErasedSurface`]: Type-erased handle to backend-specific surfaces.
//! - [`ExternalHandle`]: Exported surface handle for compositing in the host.
//! - [`CompositorSink`]: Interface through which backends submit frames.
//! - [`SurfaceSize`], [`PresentMode`], [`PixelFormat`]: Configuration types
//!   for creating surfaces.
//!
//! Backends differ in how they manage memory, synchronization, and ownership.
//! Some are CPU-bound (Cairo), others GPU-accelerated (Vello, Skia, OpenGL).
